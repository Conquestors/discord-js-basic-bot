# discord-js-basic-bot
A basic bot written in Node.js, JavaScript, and Discord.JS. This is perfect for starters and for when you want to create a new bot, you have everything ready instead of coding everything
again from scratch.

# Notes
- If you do not have any _basic knowledge_ of JavaScript whatsoever, do not attempt to persue Discord.js and make a bot just yet. It is suggested that you [Learn Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js) first before attempting to create a bot; otherwise, you may encounter future issues with your code as you are constructing a bot.

# Included in the Package
- Advanced Command Handler (Allowing multiple files (a.k.a commands) in a seperate folder titled "commands.")
- Ping Command Example

# Requirements
- A Windows OS based system
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

# Before's
- Download and install Node.js via the link above.
- Ensure you have the latest version of Node.js as it is 14.15.5+ LTS via the "Recommended" option.

# Use
Download the code to this repository using the green Download Code button, then download the zip by clicking "Download ZIP."
Unzip its contents, then open `config.json` with your desired text editor. 
It should look something similar to this:
```javascript
{
    "token": "YOUR-TOKEN",
    "prefix": "!"
}
```
Replace `YOUR-TOKEN` with your personal bot token that can be found in the Discord Developer Portal under your app, and then "Bot."
Next, open `install.bat` and allow the Command Prompt to process through the installation for the required packages. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
After the installation has finished, open `run.bat` and wait for it to log the console with the ultimate success message that the bot is now appearing online! Congratulations!

Note: This is just the basic introductory for a new Discord bot itself. If you wish, you may mess around with certain messages/events within the Example Ping file. See what you can come up with!
