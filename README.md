# discord-js-basic-bot
A basic bot written in Node.js, JavaScript, and Discord.JS. This is perfect for starters and for when you want to create a new bot, you have everything ready instead of coding everything
again from scratch.

# Included in the Package
- Advanced Command Handler
- Ping Command Example

# Use
Download the code to this repository using the green Download Code button, then download the zip by clicking "Download ZIP."
Unzip its contents, then open `config.json` with your desired text editor, and replace `YOUR-TOKEN` with your personal bot token that can be found in the Discord Developer Portal.
Next, open `install.bat` and let CMD process through to install the required packages. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
After the installation has finished, open `run.bat` and wait for it to log the console with the ultimate success message that the bot is now appearing online! Congratulations!
